    "beginnings_description": "Peach and Goma came to life in 2017 when I designed the first 'Peach Cat ®' stickers for WeChat. This charming duo—a white cat named Peach and her gray cat boyfriend, Goma—was inspired by my own relationship and everyday moments with my boyfriend. Living together, they share a love that’s sometimes cuddly, sometimes playful, and always heartwarming—reflecting the ups and downs of love that so many of us experience.",

    "global_reach_description": "What started on Weibo quickly spread beyond borders. Peach and Goma’s irresistible charm captured hearts globally, appearing on platforms like LINE, WeChat, KakaoTalk, Telegram, and WhatsApp. In 2021, I launched their official Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube channels to bring them closer to fans everywhere. It’s been an incredible journey seeing their cuteness connect with people worldwide!",
